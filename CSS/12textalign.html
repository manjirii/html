    <h1>Cakes</h1>
    <p>Cakes are sweet tender breads made with sugar and delicate flour. Cakes can vary from light,
      airy sponge cakes to dense cakes with less flour. Common flavorings include dried, candied or fresh
      fruit, nuts, cocoa or extracts. They may be filled with fruit preserves or dessert sauces
      (like pastry cream), iced with buttercream or other icings, and decorated with marzipan, piped 
      borders, or candied fruit. Cake is often served as a celebratory dish on ceremonial occasions,
       for example weddings, anniversaries, and birthdays. Small-sized cakes have become popular, in the
        form of cupcakes and petits fours, an example of which can be the Portuguese "bolo de arroz".</p>

    <h2>Puddings</h2>
    <p>are similar to custards in that their base is cream or milk. However, their primary difference is
         that puddings are thickened with starches such as corn starch or tapioca. On the other hand,
          custards are thickened using only eggs and are usually more firm.</p>

    <h3>Cakes and Pastries</h3>
    <p>A batched dough between a cake and pastry by the mix of ingredients. An Old French bescuit,
         commonly spelt in English as biscuit, is a derivation of Latin for twice-baked.[21][n 1] 
         A Dutch koekje, commonly spelt in English as cookie, is a derivation of cake-ie , meaning little
          cake.
        This form of dough can have a texture that is crisp, hard, chewy, or soft â€“ in the UK a biscuit
         is the former two and a cookie is typically the latter. Examples include a ginger nut,
          shortbread biscuit and chocolate chip cookie.
        Other small cakes and pastries can also be counted as under these terms, due to their size and
         relative similarity to cookies and biscuits, such as jaffa cakes and Eccles cakes.</p>
