<!--HTML is a markup languagee...
    Semantic markup is a markup that relates to the meaning of content...
    There are two types of tags -> i)Semantic Tags = From these tags, we an understand the meaning of tag... for eg header tag , footer tag, section tag
                                   ii)Non semantic tags = we can't understand the meaning of tag... for eg div , span tag

1)Code becomes more meaningful / layout becomes more structured
2)Website becomes SEO(Search Engine Optimization) friendly i.e website gets good ranking due to good semantic markup i.e because of good sematic markup it becomes easy for the chrome what content that website contains because of header , footer
3)website becomes more readable + improves screen readers
